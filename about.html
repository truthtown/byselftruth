    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Self Truth is built on one belief —
      <strong>clarity changes everything.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We help individuals break confusion, overcome stress
      and align their life, career and business with purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not motivation for one day,
      it is transformation for life.

  <h2>Our Journey</h2>

  <p>
    Self Truth did not start as a company.
    It started as a question —
    <strong>“Why do so many people feel lost, even when life looks fine?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Over years of real conversations, life experiences,
    failures, breakthroughs and deep self-reflection,
    one truth became clear:
    <em>People don’t need advice, they need clarity.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Self Truth exists to help individuals reconnect with themselves,
    understand their inner voice,
    and take aligned decisions in life, career and relationships.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="page-section about-extra gray">
  <h2>What Makes Self Truth Different</h2>

  <p>
    We don’t follow templates.
    We don’t push motivation.
    We don’t promise overnight success.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead, we create space —
    a space where you can slow down,
    think clearly,
    and understand what truly matters to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our approach is practical, honest and deeply personal.
    Because real change does not come from noise,
    it comes from awareness.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="page-section about-extra">
  <h2>Our Belief System</h2>

  <ul class="belief-list">
    <li>✨ Clarity is more powerful than motivation</li>
    <li>✨ Self-awareness is the foundation of success</li>
    <li>✨ Growth starts when confusion ends</li>
    <li>✨ Alignment creates confidence</li>
    <li>✨ Truth simplifies life</li>
  </ul>

<section class="page-section about-quote">
  <p>
    “When you understand yourself,
    decisions become simpler,
